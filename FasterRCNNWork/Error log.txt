Frame 38 - +1 car, difference is 141. NC wcentroid (1111, 534), DC wcentroid (1250, 560)
Frame 39 - +1 car, difference is 125. NC wcentroid (1126, 539), DC wcentroid (1250, 560)
Frame 40 - No new cars added because difference is 150. NewCar wcentroid (1103, 518), DC wcentroid (1250, 560)
Frame 55 - Newly detected car is mysteriously not added to new cars. Need to improve drawing box logic

^changed threshold to 150 to be more inclusive. Will need to see how this pans out when there are more cars in the intersection
Frame 103 - +1 car, detectedCar reset at frame 100 removes a detectedCar which is not detected again until this frame
Frame 107 - +1 car, difference is 210. NC wcentroid (801, 724), DC wcentroid (614, 627)
Frame 109 - +1 car, detectedCar reset at frame 180 removes a detectedCar which is not detected again in time for the leftover check to catch it
Frame 234 - +1 car, detectedCar reset at frame 230 removes a detectedCar which is not detected again until this frame
Frame 291 - +1 car, detectedCar reset at frame 290 removes a detectedCar which is detected again in this frame

^changed reset timer to every 17 frames
Frame 107 - +1 car, difference is 210. NC wcentroid (801, 724), DC wcentroid (614, 627)
